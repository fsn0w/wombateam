        <p class="mt-6 lg:mt-10">As you can already understand, our Wombat NFTs are quite unique and can help us create a new and impactful community-driven financial system.<br>
            But we get it, it raises quite a lot of questions, so let’s tackle them one by one:

Wait a minute! Did we just write shit? Holly crap, we did.
Why? because they give a shit! Literally.
Each Wombat can poop a number of turds according to its rarity, and we have big plans on turning these pooping machines into an impactful, community-driven financial system (see stage 3).</p>

            <h4>Stage 2 (WPOO tokens generation) Questions</h4>
            <div class="accordion mt-5 lg:mt-10">
                <div class="accordion-item border-t">

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>We’re glad you asked. These lovely marsupial creatures poop up to 80 cubes per day (yes - they drop that many cube-shaped turds each day. Magical, isn’t it?). We feel it would be a waste not to use this unique piece of information for something good, so we wrapped their poo into tokens (WPOO). That means your wombat produces WPOO every single day at 12UTC (provided you are following the <a href="<?=get_site_url()?>/the-poo-collector" target="_blank">collection rules</a>).</p>

                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>The number of WPoo tokens your wombat will produce daily will depend on its rarity. The rarer your wombat - the more tokens you will get, but it should roughly range between 40 to 80. If we could guess what’s going through your mind while reading it, it’s probably something like “holy shit”!</p>

                <div class="accordion-item">
                <button aria-expanded="false"><span class="accordion-title">How do I collect my tokens? How do I know I have tokens?</span><span class="icon" aria-hidden="true"></span></button>
                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p>You can use the <a href="https://wpoo.wombat.team/" target="_blank">WPOO Collecting DAPP</a> to view your WPOO balance and collect it.<br>

                        This is where things get really smelly and you’ll actually have to check this shit out.<br>
                        But please note that the wombats (like most of us) don’t like to be surrounded by too much shit, so the WHO (Wombat Health Organization) guidelines are to collect WPOO at least once per week.<br><br>
                        If you’ll collect it later- the Wombats will start feeling a bit overwhelmed by all this shit around them and their pooping capacity will reduce by 10% daily. If you’ll neglect your WPOO collecting duties for the whole 2 weeks - your Wombat will get so stressed - it’ll completely stop pooping.<br><br>
                        Beyond this point, nature will come to their help as the feces will start degrading daily up to the point where after further 2 weeks - there will be no more WPOO left in the burrow. At this point, the only way to get your wombat to start pooping again - will be to thoroughly clean their burrow (claim/unstake) and hope they won’t hold a grudge against you for too long and will get back to the (stinky) business sooner rather than later.

                        <p>Because you don’t shit where you eat. At least that’s the informal answer. The formal answer is that we care about the environment and don’t want you to spend too much gas on shit. </p>

                        <p>Good question. You can save, trade or put them in a (compostable) bag and throw them in the bin, BUT you can also use them to participate in the Wombat DAO activity by taking part in farming activities (see stage 3).</p>

                        This is an excellent question!

                        First of all, half of the royalties from the secondary sales of the WombaTeam NFT’s will go into the treasury.
                        <br/>
                        On top of it, unlike most of the DAOs out there, Wombat DAO will be launching without a predefined goal in mind and the DAO members will be the ones raising proposals as to particular projects & directions they’d like to build/run. It’s basically starting with a clean slate and anything should be possible, as the only limiting factor would be your imagination. Some activities could be not for profit, but other can definitely be for profit, and if built and executed properly (this is where the community plays the most important role), these would generate various revenue streams for Wombat DAO treasury.

                          You have 2 ways of getting a hold of WDAO tokens – fertilizing and farming:
                          <br/>
                          1. Fertilizing – You can deposit your WPOO tokens to the fertilizer. Your tokens will slowly disintegrate over a course of 2 weeks, and in return you will get the proportional amount of the fixed daily released WDAO tokens (according to your share of WPOO tokens in the fertilizer pile on that day).
                          <br/>
                          2. Farming – You can provide liquidity on one of the supported DEXs and receive WDAO rewards on top of 0.3% trading fee which is shared between the pool participants. There are no lockup periods, however you will be exposed to potential impermanent loss.​
